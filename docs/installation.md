# Installation

Install gridctl on macOS, Linux, or WSL2. The recommended path is the one-liner installer; package managers and pre-built binaries are documented below for users who prefer them.

## Quick install (macOS, Linux, WSL2)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridctl/gridctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the latest release to `~/.local/bin/gridctl`. The script verifies the release checksum and prints the install path and next steps.

The script can be inspected before running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridctl/gridctl/main/install.sh | less
```

> **Windows**: install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), then run the command above inside your Linux distribution.

## Package managers

<details>
<summary><strong>Homebrew</strong> (macOS, Linux)</summary>

```bash
brew install gridctl/tap/gridctl
```

Update with `brew upgrade gridctl/tap/gridctl`.

</details>

## Other options

<details>
<summary><strong>Pre-built binaries</strong></summary>

Download the tarball for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/gridctl/gridctl/releases), verify it against `checksums.txt`, extract, and place `gridctl` on your `PATH`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Requires Go 1.26+ and Node 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gridctl/gridctl
cd gridctl && make build
./gridctl --help
```

</details>

## Updating

```bash
gridctl upgrade            # check + prompt + upgrade (standalone install)
gridctl upgrade --check    # only check; do not install
gridctl upgrade --yes      # non-interactive (CI)
gridctl upgrade --version v0.1.0-beta.10   # install a specific version
```

If gridctl was installed via Homebrew, `gridctl upgrade` detects that and recommends `brew upgrade gridctl/tap/gridctl` instead.

## Uninstalling

```bash
# Standalone install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridctl/gridctl/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall

# Also remove the config directory at ~/.gridctl
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridctl/gridctl/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall --purge

# Homebrew install
brew uninstall gridctl/tap/gridctl
```

## Migrating an existing MCP setup

If your clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and others) already carry MCP server definitions, you do not need to re-type them into stack.yaml:

```bash
gridctl import                # Scan all detected clients, pick servers interactively
gridctl import cursor         # Import from one client
gridctl import --all --dry-run  # Preview everything without writing
```

The scan is read-only on client configs; the only file modified is your stack file, which is backed up first. Identical servers found in several clients are imported once (their provenance is shown), entries pointing at the gridctl gateway itself are filtered out, and plaintext secret-looking env values are offered into the encrypted variable store as `${var:KEY}` references. After importing, run `gridctl apply` to deploy and `gridctl link` to point the clients at the gateway.

## Container runtime

Gridctl requires a container runtime for workloads that run in containers (MCP servers with `image` and resources). Docker is detected by default; [Podman](https://podman.io) is also fully supported.

### Runtime detection

Gridctl auto-detects your runtime by probing sockets in this order:

1. `$DOCKER_HOST` (if set)
2. `/var/run/docker.sock` (Docker)
3. `/run/podman/podman.sock` (Podman rootful)
4. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock` (Podman rootless)

Override detection with the `--runtime` flag or `GRIDCTL_RUNTIME` environment variable:

```bash
gridctl apply stack.yaml --runtime podman
# or
GRIDCTL_RUNTIME=podman gridctl apply stack.yaml
```

### Using Podman

```bash
# Install Podman (macOS)
brew install podman
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Install Podman (Linux)
sudo apt install podman        # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install podman        # Fedora/RHEL

# Enable the Podman socket (Linux rootless)
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket

# Verify gridctl detects Podman
gridctl info
```

Podman 4.0+ is required for rootless multi-container networking (netavark + aardvark-dns). Podman 4.7+ is recommended for full `host.containers.internal` support. Older versions fall back to the Docker-compatible `host.docker.internal` alias. SELinux volume labels (`:Z`) are applied automatically when Podman is running on an SELinux-enforcing system.
