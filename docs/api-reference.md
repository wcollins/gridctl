# REST API Reference

The gridctl gateway exposes a REST API for managing stacks, secrets, skills, and MCP protocol interactions. By default the gateway listens on port `8180`.

## Authentication

When `gateway.auth` is configured, all endpoints except `/health` and `/ready` require authentication. CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests are also exempt.

**Bearer token:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8180/api/status
```

**API key:**
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: <token>" http://localhost:8180/api/status
```

Token comparison uses constant-time equality to prevent timing attacks.

## Endpoints

### Health & Readiness

#### `GET /health`

Liveness check. Returns `200 OK` immediately without checking MCP server status.

**Auth:** No

```bash
curl http://localhost:8180/health
```

```
OK
```

#### `GET /ready`

Readiness check. Returns `200 OK` only when all MCP servers are connected and initialized. Returns `503 Service Unavailable` in two cases: any MCP server is not yet ready, or the daemon is running in stackless mode (no stack loaded yet - use `POST /api/stack/initialize` or the wizard to load one).

**Auth:** No

```bash
curl http://localhost:8180/ready
```

```
OK
```

---

### Status & Monitoring

#### `GET /api/status`

Returns the overall gateway status including servers, resources, sessions, and optional features.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/status
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `gateway` | object | Gateway name and version |
| `mcp-servers` | []object | Status of each MCP server |
| `resources` | []object | Resource container status |
| `sessions` | int | Active SSE session count |
| `stack_name` | string | Active stack name (omitted in stackless mode) |
| `registry` | object | Registry skill counts (omitted if empty) |
| `code_mode` | string | Code mode status (omitted if `"off"`) |
| `token_usage` | object | Token usage metrics (omitted if no metrics accumulator) |
| `cost` | object | USD cost snapshot (omitted when no cost has been recorded) |

**Token usage fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session` | object | Aggregate token counts (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`) |
| `per_server` | map | Token counts keyed by server name |
| `per_client` | map | Token counts keyed by normalized MCP client name (omitted when no per-client traffic has been observed) |
| `format_savings` | object | Savings from output format conversion (`original_tokens`, `formatted_tokens`, `saved_tokens`, `savings_percent`) |

**Cost fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session` | object | Aggregate USD cost (`input_usd`, `output_usd`, `cache_read_usd`, `cache_write_usd`, `total_usd`) |
| `per_server` | map | USD cost keyed by server name |
| `per_replica` | map | USD cost keyed by `(server, replica_id)` (omitted when no replica-aware traffic has been observed) |
| `per_client` | map | USD cost keyed by normalized MCP client name (omitted when no per-client traffic has been observed) |

**MCP server status** includes `outputFormat` (string, omitted when unset) showing the configured output format for each server, `autoscale` (object, omitted when the server has no autoscale block) described under [`/api/mcp-servers`](#get-apimcp-servers), `model` (string, omitted when empty) showing the declared per-server pricing model, and `effectiveModel` (object, omitted until traffic is observed) reporting which model actually priced the server's recorded cost. Each registered server also reports `protocolVersion` (string, omitted when the server did not report one or has no MCP handshake, as with OpenAPI adapters) carrying the MCP protocol version negotiated at initialize. A server that failed gateway registration (unreachable endpoint, initialize failure, or unsupported protocol version) still appears in the list with `registrationFailed: true`, `healthy: false`, the failure reason in `healthError`, `initialized: false`, and no replicas, so declared servers are never silently absent.

**Cost-attribution fields** appear at the top level when any client or server declares a pricing model in `stack.yaml`, and are omitted otherwise:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cost_attribution` | bool | True when at least one client or server has a declared model, so the UI shows real cost instead of `$0.00` |
| `default_model` | string | Gateway-level `default_model` from `stack.yaml` |
| `server_models` | map | Effective server -> model map (per-server `model:` with `default_model` folded in) |
| `client_models` | map | Declared client ID -> model map from `client_models:` |
| `effective_server_models` | map | Server -> `{model, provenance, share, models}` reporting which model priced each server's cost (`provenance` is `declared`, `mixed`, or `none`) |
| `effective_client_models` | map | Client -> effective-model object, same shape as above |

#### `GET /api/sessions`

Returns the active Streamable HTTP MCP session count and the list of session IDs.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/sessions
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "sessions": ["sess-abc123", "sess-def456"]
}
```

#### `GET /api/mcp-servers`

Returns MCP server status details. Response fields match the `mcp-servers[]` entries under [`/api/status`](#get-apistatus).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers
```

**Autoscale fields** - servers configured with an `autoscale` block (see [config-schema.md#autoscale](config-schema.md#autoscale)) include an `autoscale` object in their status:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `min` | int | Configured floor |
| `max` | int | Configured ceiling |
| `current` | int | Running replica count at the last controller tick |
| `target` | int | Desired replica count at the last controller tick |
| `targetInFlight` | int | Configured per-replica in-flight target |
| `medianInFlight` | int | Rolling median in-flight request count across healthy replicas |

| `lastScaleDownAt` | string | RFC3339 timestamp of the most recent scale-down (omitted when none) |
| `lastDecision` | string | `"up"`, `"down"`, or `"noop"` - what the controller just decided |
| `warmPool` | int | Configured warm-pool (omitted when 0) |
| `idleToZero` | bool | Configured scale-to-zero (omitted when false) |

#### `GET /api/tools`

Returns all aggregated tools from registered MCP servers.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/tools
```

#### `GET /api/tools/catalog`

Returns the full downstream tool inventory (each tool's raw description and input schema) for the web console, regardless of code mode. Read-only and informational: it does not change what MCP clients see from `tools/list`. The response shape matches [`/api/tools`](#get-apitools).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/tools/catalog
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "github__get_file_contents",
      "description": "Get file contents from a repository",
      "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": {} }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `GET /api/tools/usage`

Returns per-(server, tool) usage observed by the gateway: cumulative call count, last-called timestamp, token counts, and estimated cost. Powers the Tools workspace **Audit Mode** (which separates actively-used, configured-but-unused, and disabled tools), the Tools detail panel's Usage section, and the Metrics workspace's Tools scope.

Usage is recorded for both direct tool calls and tools invoked through code mode's `execute` (both flow through the same observer). For servers with metrics persistence enabled, the data is restored from disk on startup so it survives gateway restarts; otherwise it reflects activity since the last gateway start.

`observedSince` is when this gateway process began recording. With persistence enabled, restored counts and timestamps may predate it; clients should treat tools absent from `servers` (or with no `lastCalledAt`) as "no recorded calls" rather than asserting a longer disuse history than `observedSince` supports.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/tools/usage
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "observedSince": "2026-05-20T10:00:00Z",
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "create_issue": { "calls": 42, "lastCalledAt": "2026-05-24T09:13:00Z", "inputTokens": 5120, "outputTokens": 18400, "costUsd": 0.291 },
      "list_repos": { "calls": 3, "lastCalledAt": "2026-05-21T08:00:00Z", "inputTokens": 240, "outputTokens": 900 }
    }
  }
}
```

`servers` is an object keyed by server name; each value maps unprefixed tool names to their stats. Tools that have never been called are omitted. `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` are the cumulative tokens of the tool's own calls (omitted when zero). `costUsd` is the cumulative estimated cost of the tool's priced calls and is omitted entirely (never `0`) when no call was priced, for example when no pricing model is declared. Returns `503` when no metrics accumulator is configured.

#### `GET /api/skills/usage`

Returns per-skill cumulative `prompts/get` usage observed by the gateway: a call count and the last-called timestamp for each registry skill that has been served. Powers the Skills Library's usage labelling. The data is seeded from disk on startup when metrics persistence is enabled, so it survives gateway restarts; otherwise it reflects activity since the last gateway start.

`observedSince` is when this gateway process began recording; with persistence enabled, restored counts may predate it, so the Library uses it to label the young-tracking-window case rather than calling a skill unused. Both `observedSince` and a skill's `lastCalledAt` are rendered as `null` (not omitted) when no value exists, keeping the join shape stable.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/skills/usage
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "observedSince": "2026-05-20T10:00:00Z",
  "skills": {
    "code-review": { "calls": 17, "lastCalledAt": "2026-05-24T09:13:00Z" },
    "release-notes": { "calls": 2, "lastCalledAt": null }
  }
}
```

`skills` is always a non-nil object (`{}` when nothing has been served). Returns `503` when no metrics accumulator is configured.

#### `GET /api/logs`

Returns structured log entries from the gateway log buffer.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `lines` | int | `100` | Number of recent log entries to return |
| `level` | string | - | Comma-separated level filter (e.g., `"ERROR,WARN"`) |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/logs?lines=50&level=ERROR,WARN"
```

#### `GET /api/clients`

Returns detected LLM clients and their link status.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/clients
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Claude Desktop",
    "slug": "claude",
    "detected": true,
    "linked": true,
    "transport": "sse",
    "configPath": "/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json",
    "effectiveScope": {
      "configured": true,
      "unscoped": false,
      "servers": ["github"],
      "tools": ["github__search-repos", "github__create-issue"]
    }
  }
]
```

`effectiveScope` is the backend-computed per-client access scope when a
`clients:` block is configured (servers and prefixed tools the client can
reach). It is absent when no scoping is in effect.

Each client entry also carries `model` (string, omitted when empty) for the declared per-client pricing model and `effectiveModel` (object, omitted until traffic is observed) reporting which model actually priced the client's cost, with `provenance` (`declared`, `mixed`, or `none`).

When the stack has a `link:` block, declared clients additionally carry
`declared: true` and a `linkEntry` object with the declared options (`group`,
`clientId`, `name`), so the UI can render desired state (declared) next to
actual state (linked). For a declared entry whose resolved server name differs
from the default (a `group` or `name` override), `linked` reflects that
resolved entry name.

#### `POST /api/clients/{slug}/scope/preview`

Computes what committing a per-client access-scope draft would do, without touching the stack file. Returns the exact YAML patch the matching `PUT .../scope` would write plus a per-client impact summary, so the UI's commit gate can render the consequences (and block a lockout) before saving.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"servers": ["github"], "tools": []}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/clients/cursor/scope/preview
```

**Request body:** same shape as the scope `PUT` (`servers` and `tools` allow-lists). At least one of `servers` or `tools` must be set.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "client": "cursor",
  "profileKey": "cursor",
  "createsBlock": true,
  "lockout": false,
  "totalServers": 4,
  "totalTools": 43,
  "diff": "--- stack.yaml\n+++ stack.yaml\n@@ ...",
  "selected": {
    "name": "Cursor",
    "slug": "cursor",
    "beforeServers": 4,
    "afterServers": 1,
    "beforeTools": 43,
    "afterTools": 12,
    "lostServers": ["gitlab", "jira", "slack"],
    "gainedServers": []
  },
  "affected": []
}
```

`createsBlock` is `true` when no `clients:` block exists yet, in which case `affected` lists the other linked clients that flip to default-deny. `lockout` is `true` when the resulting scope would leave the client able to reach nothing.

**Errors:** `400 invalid_client` (empty after normalization) or a missing scope axis; `422` (`unknown_server`/`unknown_tool`) when the draft references a server or tool the gateway does not know; `503` when no stack file is configured or the gateway is unavailable.

#### `PUT /api/clients/{slug}/scope`

Sets a client's server-level access profile in the `clients:` block of the live
stack YAML and triggers a hot reload. The slug is normalized to the stable
profile key used for enforcement. The write is atomic and conflict-detected.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"servers": ["github"], "tools": []}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/clients/cursor/scope
```

**Request body:** `servers` and `tools` are allow-lists; an empty `tools`
leaves the client unrestricted within its allowed servers.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "client": "cursor",
  "profileKey": "cursor",
  "servers": ["github"],
  "tools": [],
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2026-05-29T17:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `422` (`unknown_server`/`unknown_tool`) when the scope references a
server or tool the gateway does not know; `409` (`stack_modified`) when the
stack file changed on disk since it was read; `502` (`reload_failed`) when the
write succeeded but the hot reload failed.

---

### Token Metrics

#### `POST /api/clients/{slug}/link`

Links a client to the gateway (writing its own config file, exactly as
`gridctl link` would) and declares it in the stack's `link:` block, so the UI
and stack.yaml stay in lockstep. The dual write is ordered: the stack patch is
precomputed first (a malformed stack rejects the request with no host write),
then the client config is written, then the stack file. These endpoints write
files in the operator's home directory — the same local-operator capability
the vault and stack-editing endpoints already assume.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"group": "dev", "clientId": "cursor"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/clients/cursor/link
```

**Request body (all optional):** `group` links the tool group's endpoint (the
entry name defaults to `gridctl-<group>`), `clientId` binds the link to a
`clients:` access profile, `name` overrides the server entry name.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "client": "cursor",
  "serverName": "gridctl-dev",
  "linked": true,
  "declared": true,
  "configPath": "/home/user/.cursor/mcp.json"
}
```

`alreadyLinked: true` is added when the client config already carried the
identical entry (declaring adopts it).

**Errors:** `404 unknown_client`; `422 client_not_detected`; `409
link_conflict` when a foreign entry occupies the target name (nothing is
written); `500 stack_not_updated` when the client config was written but the
stack file was not (external edit or write failure — both facts are in the
message; nothing is rolled back); `503` when no stack file is configured.

#### `DELETE /api/clients/{slug}/link`

Removes the client's gateway entry and its `link:` declaration, unlink-first.
The declared entry fixes the server name to remove; an undeclared client falls
back to the default. Returns `404` when the client is neither linked nor
declared, and `500 stack_not_updated` when the unlink succeeded but the stack
write did not.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `POST /api/clients/{slug}/link/preview`

Computes what linking would change without writing anything: the client config
before and after, plus the unified diff of the stack.yaml `link:` patch.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "client": "cursor",
  "serverName": "gridctl",
  "configPath": "/home/user/.cursor/mcp.json",
  "before": "{ ... current config ... }",
  "after": "{ ... config with gridctl entry ... }",
  "stackDiff": "--- stack.yaml\n+++ stack.yaml\n@@ ..."
}
```

#### `GET /api/metrics/tokens`

Returns historical token usage time-series data.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `range` | string | `"1h"` | Time range: `"30m"`, `"1h"`, `"6h"`, `"24h"`, `"7d"` |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/metrics/tokens?range=1h"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "range": "1h",
  "interval": "1m",
  "data_points": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-03-12T10:00:00Z",
      "input_tokens": 1200,
      "output_tokens": 800,
      "total_tokens": 2000
    }
  ],
  "per_server": {
    "github": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2026-03-12T10:00:00Z",
        "input_tokens": 1200,
        "output_tokens": 800,
        "total_tokens": 2000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### `DELETE /api/metrics/tokens`

Clears all accumulated token metrics.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/metrics/tokens
```

**Response:**
```json
{"status": "ok", "message": "Token metrics cleared"}
```

---

### Cost Metrics

#### `GET /api/metrics/cost`

Returns historical USD cost time-series data, mirroring the `/api/metrics/tokens` shape. Cost is computed at observation time using the active pricing source (LiteLLM by default) and never recomputed from stored token totals.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `range` | string | `"1h"` | Time range: `"30m"`, `"1h"`, `"6h"`, `"24h"`, `"7d"` |
| `per_client` | bool | `false` | When `true`, the response includes a `per_client` map grouping cost by the originating MCP client (e.g. `claude-code`, `cursor`). |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/metrics/cost?range=24h&per_client=true"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "range": "24h",
  "interval": "1h",
  "data_points": [
    {"timestamp": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z", "usd": 0.42}
  ],
  "per_server": {
    "github": [{"timestamp": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z", "usd": 0.42}]
  },
  "per_client": {
    "claude-code": [{"timestamp": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z", "usd": 0.30}],
    "cursor":      [{"timestamp": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z", "usd": 0.12}]
  }
}
```

#### `DELETE /api/metrics/cost`

Clears recorded cost data while leaving token counters and the format-savings tally intact. Use this when rotating pricing sources or recovering from a bad pricing snapshot without losing token history.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/metrics/cost
```

**Response:**
```json
{"status": "ok", "message": "Cost metrics cleared"}
```

---

### Optimize

#### `GET /api/optimize`

Returns an `OptimizeReport` derived from gateway-observed data: the registered server list, per-server token + cost totals, and per-(server, tool) call counts. v1 implements the `unused_server` and `unused_tool` heuristics; gateways with less than 24h of observation get a single `info` finding ("need more data") so reports never over-fire.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `stack` | string | - | Active stack name. `404` if it does not match. |
| `min_impact` | float | `0` | Drop findings whose weekly USD impact is below this threshold. `info` findings are always retained. |
| `severity` | string | - | Comma-separated allowlist of `info`, `warn`, `critical`. |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/optimize?min_impact=0.10"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "unused-server-github",
      "heuristic": "unused_server",
      "severity": "warn",
      "title": "Unused server: github",
      "summary": "Server 'github' has registered 12 tools but no calls have been observed.",
      "server": "github",
      "impact_usd_per_week": 0.27,
      "remediation": "# Remove the server entirely:\nmcp-servers:\n  # delete the entry for: github\n",
      "detected_at": "2026-05-07T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "health_score": 90,
  "generated_at": "2026-05-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Returns `503` when no metrics accumulator is configured; `404` when `stack` does not match the active stack.

---

### Groups

#### `GET /api/groups`

Returns every tool group declared under `groups:` in stack.yaml, resolved against the live tool surface. Backs `gridctl groups`. Always `200`: with no groups configured the payload carries `configured: false` and an empty array. Each group also serves MCP at `GET|POST|DELETE /groups/{name}/mcp` (and a negotiation hint at `GET /groups/{name}/sse`); unknown group names return `404` before any session is created.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/groups
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "release",
      "description": "Release engineering bundle",
      "endpoint": "/groups/release/mcp",
      "member_count": 12,
      "tools": ["create_issue", "github__search_code", "gitlab__create_merge_request"],
      "overrides": {"github__create_issue": "create_issue"}
    }
  ]
}
```

`tools` are the exposed (post-rename) names; `overrides` maps canonical member names to their renames (empty string for description- or annotation-only overrides). The pins drift endpoint (`GET /api/pins/{server}/diff`) adds a `groups_rewriting` array to any drifted tool whose description a group rewrites.

---

### Limits

#### `GET /api/limits`

Returns the consumption snapshot for every budget and rate limit declared under `limits:` in stack.yaml. Backs `gridctl limits` and the Metrics workspace. Always `200`: with no limits configured the payload carries `configured: false` and an empty `entries` array.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/limits
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "entries": [
    {
      "kind": "budget",
      "scope": "client",
      "key": "claude-code",
      "state": "warn",
      "budget": {
        "max_usd": 5,
        "spent_usd": 4.12,
        "percent": 82.4,
        "period": "daily",
        "warn_at_percent": 80,
        "window_start": "2026-07-20T00:00:00-04:00",
        "window_end": "2026-07-21T00:00:00-04:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "kind": "rate",
      "scope": "server",
      "key": "github",
      "state": "ok",
      "rate": {
        "calls_per_minute": 30,
        "burst": 10
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`state` is `ok`, `warn` (budget past its `warn_at_percent`), or `exceeded`. Budget entries carry the active calendar window; rate entries report their configured bucket. Hot-reload edits to the `limits:` block are reflected on the next request.

---

### Traces

Read the gateway's in-memory distributed-trace buffer. Each trace captures the spans for one upstream operation (tool call, prompt, etc.).

#### `GET /api/traces`

Returns recent trace summaries, newest first.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `server` | string | - | Filter to traces for this server |
| `errors` | bool | `false` | When `true`, return only traces that contain an error |
| `minDuration` | string | - | Minimum duration: a Go duration (e.g. `"250ms"`, `"2s"`) or a bare integer in milliseconds (e.g. `500`). Unparseable values return `400` |
| `limit` | int | `100` | Maximum number of traces to return |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/traces?errors=true&limit=20"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "traces": [
    {
      "traceId": "a1b2c3",
      "rootSpanId": "root-1",
      "operation": "github › create_issue",
      "tool": "create_issue",
      "client": "claude-code",
      "server": "github",
      "startTime": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.123456789Z",
      "duration": 142,
      "spanCount": 3,
      "hasError": false,
      "status": "ok"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "tracingEnabled": true,
  "bufferSize": 42,
  "bufferCapacity": 1000
}
```

`duration` is in milliseconds. `status` is `"ok"` or `"error"`. `tool` is the resolved tool name (empty when the call failed before routing); `client` is the connecting client's name (empty when the client did not identify itself). `bufferSize` and `bufferCapacity` describe ring-buffer occupancy against `gateway.tracing.max_traces`. When no trace buffer is configured the envelope is empty with `"tracingEnabled": false`, which distinguishes disabled tracing from an enabled but quiet buffer.

#### `GET /api/traces/{traceId}`

Returns the full span tree for a single trace.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/traces/a1b2c3
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "traceId": "a1b2c3",
  "spans": [
    {
      "spanId": "root-1",
      "parentSpanId": "",
      "name": "github › create_issue",
      "startTime": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.123456789Z",
      "endTime": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.265456789Z",
      "duration": 142,
      "status": "ok",
      "attributes": { "server.name": "github", "mcp.tool.name": "create_issue" },
      "events": []
    },
    {
      "spanId": "span-2",
      "parentSpanId": "root-1",
      "name": "mcp.client.call_tool",
      "startTime": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.128456789Z",
      "endTime": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.260456789Z",
      "duration": 132,
      "status": "ok",
      "attributes": { "server.name": "github", "tool.name": "create_issue" },
      "events": [
        { "name": "retry", "timestamp": "2026-05-29T17:00:00.150456789Z", "attributes": { "reason": "backoff" } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`parentSpanId` is empty for root spans. `endTime` is RFC3339Nano and may be absent for traces persisted before it was serialized; clients should derive `startTime + duration` in that case. Returns `404` when the trace ID is not in the buffer.

#### `GET /api/traces/{traceId}/otlp`

Returns a single trace as an OTLP/JSON `TracesData` document, suitable for an OTel Collector `file` receiver or any OTLP JSON decoder. Follows the OTLP/JSON encoding rules: lowerCamelCase keys, `traceId`/`spanId` as hex strings, and nanosecond timestamps as JSON strings. Served with a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/traces/a1b2c3/otlp -o trace.json
```

Returns `404` when the trace ID is not in the buffer or tracing is disabled.

---

### Hot Reload

#### `POST /api/reload`

Triggers a configuration reload from the stack file. Requires the gateway to have been started with `--watch`.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/reload
```

**Response (success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reload complete",
  "added": ["new-server"],
  "removed": [],
  "modified": ["existing-server"]
}
```

**Response (no changes):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "No changes detected"
}
```

**Response (error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "validation errors:\n  - mcp-servers[0].port: must be a positive integer"
}
```

Returns `503` if reload is not enabled (gateway started without `--watch`).

---

### Stack Management

Endpoints for validating, inspecting, and editing the active stack spec. Most write paths use the same lock + hash + atomic-write pattern as the tool-whitelist editor: concurrent external edits surface as `409 stack_modified`, and a successful write may trigger a hot reload (`502 reload_failed` when the YAML saved but reload failed).

#### `POST /api/stack/validate`

Validates a stack YAML body without saving. Matches `gridctl validate` semantics (env expansion, defaults, full rule set).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
  --data-binary @stack.yaml \
  http://localhost:8180/api/stack/validate
```

**Response:** `ValidationResult` JSON (`valid`, `errorCount`, `warningCount`, `issues[]`).

#### `GET /api/stack/plan`

Compares the on-disk stack file against the running state and returns a plan diff. Powers the canvas drift indicator.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stack/plan
```

Returns `503` when no stack is deployed.

#### `GET /api/stack/health`

Returns aggregate spec health: validation status, drift vs running state, dependency resolution, and per-replica health for multi-replica servers.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stack/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "validation": { "status": "valid", "errorCount": 0, "warningCount": 0 },
  "drift": { "status": "in-sync" },
  "dependencies": { "status": "resolved" },
  "replicas": {
    "github": [
      { "replicaId": "github-0", "state": "healthy", "inFlight": 0, "uptimeSeconds": 3600 }
    ]
  }
}
```

`validation.status` is `valid`, `warnings`, or `errors`. `drift.status` is `in-sync`, `drifted`, or `unknown`.

#### `GET /api/stack/spec`

Returns the raw `stack.yaml` content for the active stack.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stack/spec
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "path": "/path/to/stack.yaml", "content": "version: \"1\"\n..." }
```

#### `GET /api/stack/export`

Returns the active stack as sanitized exportable YAML (sensitive env values replaced with `${vault:...}` placeholders).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stack/export
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "content": "version: \"1\"\n...", "format": "yaml" }
```

#### `GET /api/stack/recipes`

Returns built-in stack templates for the wizard.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stack/recipes
```

**Response:** JSON array of `{id, name, description, category, spec}` objects.

#### `GET /api/catalog`

Searches the server catalog: the curated set embedded in the binary merged with MCP Registry results (curated first, deduped by registry namespace). Backs the wizard's catalog picker; same data as `gridctl search`. The endpoint never fails because the registry is down; degraded results carry `registry_error` or `stale` instead.

**Auth:** Yes

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `q` | Search query. Empty lists the curated catalog only; the registry is not contacted. |
| `source` | `curated`, `registry`, or `all` (default `all`). |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/catalog?q=postgres"
```

**Response:** `{query, source, stale?, registry_error?, servers: [...]}` where each server is a full catalog entry (`name`, `title`, `description`, `tier`, `status`, `install`, `inputs`, ...). Secret input defaults are always empty.

#### `POST /api/stack/append`

Appends an `mcp-server` or `resource` snippet to the live `stack.yaml`. The snippet is validated before write; comments and key ordering elsewhere in the file are preserved.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resourceType": "mcp-server", "yaml": "name: new-server\nimage: alpine\n..."}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/stack/append
```

`resourceType` must be `mcp-server` or `resource`. Returns `422` with a `validation` object when the post-append stack would be invalid.

#### `POST /api/stack/initialize`

Cold-loads a saved stack into a stackless daemon (`gridctl serve`). Starts the file watcher when one is configured.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-stack"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/stack/initialize
```

Loads `~/.gridctl/stacks/<name>.yaml`. Returns `409` when a stack is already loaded; `400` with per-server `errors[]` when initialization fails.

#### `PATCH /api/stack/telemetry`

Updates the top-level `telemetry:` block in the live stack YAML (persist defaults and retention). Returns a refreshed telemetry inventory in the response.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persist": {"logs": true, "metrics": true}, "retention": {"max_size_mb": 50}}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/stack/telemetry
```

At least one `persist` or `retention` field must be set. Omitted sub-fields are left unchanged.

---

### Stack Library

Saved stacks live under `~/.gridctl/stacks/` as `<name>.yaml`.

#### `GET /api/stacks`

Lists saved stacks.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/stacks
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "stacks": [{ "name": "my-stack", "path": "/Users/me/.gridctl/stacks/my-stack.yaml" }] }
```

#### `POST /api/stacks`

Saves a stack YAML to the library.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-stack", "yaml": "version: \"1\"\nname: my-stack\n..."}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/stacks
```

`name` must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`. Returns `400` when the YAML does not parse as a valid stack.

---

### Wizard Drafts

Persists in-progress wizard form state under `~/.gridctl/cache/wizard-drafts/`.

#### `GET /api/wizard/drafts`

Lists saved wizard drafts, newest first.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/wizard/drafts
```

**Response:** JSON array of `{id, name, resourceType, formData, createdAt, updatedAt}`.

#### `POST /api/wizard/drafts`

Creates a new wizard draft.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "GitHub MCP", "resourceType": "mcp-server", "formData": {}}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/wizard/drafts
```

**Response:** `201 Created` with the draft object (server-generated `id`).

#### `DELETE /api/wizard/drafts/{id}`

Deletes a wizard draft.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/wizard/drafts/abc123
```

**Response:** `204 No Content`

---

### MCP Server Control

#### `POST /api/mcp-servers/{name}/restart`

Restarts an individual MCP server connection. For container-based servers (stdio transport), this restarts the Docker container and re-establishes the MCP session. For external servers (HTTP/SSE), this re-initializes the MCP handshake and refreshes tools. For process-based servers (local, SSH), this kills and restarts the process.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/github/restart
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "restarted",
  "server": "github"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` - Server name not found in gateway
- `500` - Restart failed (container error, connection timeout, etc.)

#### `GET /api/mcp-servers/{name}/logs`

Returns structured log entries from the gateway log buffer filtered to the named server.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `lines` | int | `100` | Number of recent log entries to return for this server |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/github/logs?lines=50"
```

The response is the same JSON array of buffered entries as [`/api/logs`](#get-apilogs), limited to entries tagged with the requested server. Returns an empty array (`[]`) when no log buffer is configured.

#### `PUT /api/mcp-servers/{name}/tools`

Updates an MCP server's tool whitelist in the live `stack.yaml` and triggers a hot reload. Powers the live tool whitelist editor in the Stack sidebar. The YAML write is atomic; concurrent external edits surface as `409` so the UI can re-fetch without clobbering changes.

**Auth:** Yes

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tools": ["get_file_contents", "search_code"]}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/github/tools
```

The body must be a JSON object with a `tools` field. An empty array (`[]`) clears the filter and exposes all server tools. The request body is capped at 64 KiB.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "server": "github",
  "tools": ["get_file_contents", "search_code"],
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

`reloaded` is `false` when the daemon is running without live-reload; the UI should hint the user to run `gridctl reload` manually. `reloadedAt` is omitted in that case.

**Errors:**
- `400 unknown_tool` - Tool name not advertised by the server (whitelist is stale)
- `400` - Body missing `tools` array, or contains an empty tool name
- `404` - Server not found in the stack file
- `409 stack_modified` - Stack file changed on disk between read and write
- `502 reload_failed` - YAML written but hot reload failed
- `503` - No stack file configured (stackless mode)

#### `PUT /api/mcp-servers/tools`

Applies tool-whitelist changes to **multiple** servers in one atomic `stack.yaml` write and triggers a **single** hot reload, the fleet-bulk counterpart to the per-server endpoint above. Powers the Tools workspace bulk actions (fleet-wide expose-all / clear / pattern filtering), where applying N servers via N single-server calls would cost N reloads.

**Transaction semantics: all-or-nothing.** Every server's tools are validated before anything is written; if any tool is unknown the whole batch is rejected (`400 unknown_tool`, naming the offending server) and the stack file is left untouched. This prevents a half-applied fleet edit. The reload runs once after the single write.

**Auth:** Yes

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"servers": [
        {"name": "github", "tools": ["search_code"]},
        {"name": "atlassian", "tools": []}
      ]}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/tools
```

The body must be a JSON object with a non-empty `servers` array; each entry needs a `name` and a `tools` array (`[]` clears that server's whitelist = expose all). Server names must be unique within the batch. The body is capped at 512 KiB.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "servers": [
    { "server": "github", "tools": ["search_code"] },
    { "server": "atlassian", "tools": [] }
  ],
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

`reloaded`/`reloadedAt` follow the single-server rules (one reload for the whole batch; `false` without live-reload).

**Errors:**
- `400 unknown_tool` - A tool name is not advertised by its server (message names the server); nothing written
- `400` - Body missing/empty `servers`, an entry missing `name`/`tools`, a duplicate server, or an empty tool name
- `404` - A named server is not in the stack file; nothing written
- `409 stack_modified` - Stack file changed on disk between read and write; nothing written
- `502 reload_failed` - YAML written but hot reload failed
- `503` - No stack file configured (stackless mode)

#### `POST /api/servers/probe`

Probes an external URL (or any other) MCP server configuration ephemerally and returns its advertised tool list, without registering it with the gateway. Powers the wizard's "Discover tools" button on the MCP server form.

**Auth:** Yes

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: wizard-1" \
  -d '{"name":"remote","url":"https://mcp.example.com/sse"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/servers/probe
```

The body mirrors the MCP server config (`name`, `image`, `source`, `url`, `port`, `transport`, `command`, `env`, `build_args`, `network`, `ssh`, `openapi`, `tools`, `output_format`, `ready_timeout`, `replicas`, `auth`). The `auth` block uses the stack YAML shape (`type`, `token`, `header`, `value`, `scopes`, `client_id`, `client_secret`) so Test Connection can probe protected external servers; a `type: oauth` server with no stored broker tokens returns the `needs_auth` code. The body is capped at 64 KiB.

`X-Session-ID` is optional; when absent, the remote address is used for per-session accounting. Concurrency is capped at **3 in-flight probes per session** and **10 globally** - excess requests get `429` (session) or `503` (global) with `Retry-After: 3`.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "fetch_url",
      "description": "Fetch the contents of a URL",
      "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "url": {"type": "string"} } }
    }
  ],
  "probedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "cached": false
}
```

**Error envelope:**
```json
{ "error": { "code": "invalid_config", "message": "...", "hint": "..." } }
```

Error codes:
- `invalid_config` (400) - Body malformed or required fields missing
- `rate_limited` (429 / 503) - Session or global probe cap exceeded
- `unsupported_transport` (503) - Probe is not configured on this daemon
- `internal` (500) - Unexpected probe failure
- Other codes (422) - Probe ran but the upstream rejected the handshake

Env-var values and auth secrets (`auth.token`, `auth.value`, `auth.client_secret`) present in the request body are scrubbed from error messages and hints to avoid leaking secrets.

#### `PATCH /api/mcp-servers/{name}/telemetry`

Updates the per-server `telemetry.persist` overrides in the live stack YAML. Each signal (`logs`, `metrics`, `traces`) can be set to `true`, `false`, or `null` (clear the override and inherit the stack default). Send `persist: null` to remove the entire per-server telemetry block.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persist": {"logs": true, "metrics": null}}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/github/telemetry
```

**Response:** `{success: true, inventory: [...]}` — same inventory shape as `GET /api/telemetry/inventory`.

**Errors:** `404` when the server is not in the stack; `409 stack_modified`; `502 reload_failed`; `503` when no stack file is configured.

---

### Downstream Server Authorization (OAuth)

These endpoints drive OAuth 2.1 brokering for external URL servers declared with `auth: {type: oauth}` in `stack.yaml`. They power the sidebar Authorize flow in the web UI and the `gridctl auth` command group. The `/api/*` endpoints return `501` when OAuth brokering is disabled on the daemon (the encrypted token store failed to initialize); with brokering enabled but no OAuth-configured servers, `GET /api/auth/servers` returns an empty list. `/oauth/callback` is mounted only when brokering is enabled.

#### `GET /api/auth/servers`

Returns per-server downstream authorization state for every OAuth-configured server.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/auth/servers
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "server": "notion",
    "resource": "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp",
    "status": "needs_auth",
    "issuer": "https://auth.notion.com",
    "scopes": ["read", "write"],
    "expiry": "2026-07-19T12:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

`status` is `authorized` or `needs_auth`. `issuer`, `scopes`, and `expiry` are present only when a grant is stored.

#### `POST /api/servers/{name}/auth/login`

Starts the authorization-code flow for a server: discovers the authorization server, registers or reuses a client, and returns the URL the browser must open plus the single-use `state` token that keys the flow.

**Auth:** Yes

**Request:** optional JSON body `{"timeoutSeconds": 300}`; an empty body keeps the broker default. The timeout is capped at 15 minutes.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{}' http://localhost:8180/api/servers/notion/auth/login
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "authorize_url": "https://auth.notion.com/authorize?client_id=...&state=...",
  "state": "b64-opaque-state"
}
```

**Errors:** `502` when discovery or client registration fails.

#### `GET /api/servers/{name}/auth/wait?state=...`

Long-polls until the flow keyed by `state` completes, fails, or times out. Resolving with `200` means authorized; the UI uses this to flip from "Waiting for provider" to done.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{"status": "authorized"}`

**Errors:** `400` when `state` is missing; `502` when the flow failed or timed out.

#### `POST /api/servers/{name}/auth/manual`

Completes a flow from a pasted redirect URL - the `--manual` path for sessions where the browser cannot reach the daemon's callback (e.g. over SSH).

**Auth:** Yes

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"redirectUrl": "http://localhost:8180/oauth/callback?code=...&state=..."}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/servers/notion/auth/manual
```

**Response:** `{"status": "authorized"}`

**Errors:** `400` when `redirectUrl` is missing; `502` when the code exchange fails.

#### `POST /api/servers/{name}/auth/logout`

Revokes (best effort) and deletes the stored grant for a server.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{"status": "logged_out"}`

#### `POST /api/servers/{name}/auth/reset`

Deletes the stored grant **and** the cached dynamic client registration for a server. Use this when logins keep failing after the provider rotated or deleted the OAuth app - the next login re-registers from scratch.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{"status": "reset"}`

#### `GET /oauth/callback`

The authorization-code redirect target. Mounted **outside** the inbound auth middleware - the provider's browser redirect cannot carry a gateway bearer token - and authenticated by the flow's single-use `state` parameter instead. Serves a small HTML page that closes the popup. Not called directly by API clients.

### Model Attribution

These endpoints declare the pricing model used to cost tool calls, written into the live `stack.yaml` and applied via a hot reload. They affect cost attribution only and carry no access-control meaning. Precedence at pricing time is call-level, then client, then server, then gateway default. Unknown model IDs are accepted (best-effort pricing), surfacing only as load-time validation warnings. Each write is atomic and conflict-detected; an external edit between read and write returns `409`.

#### `PUT /api/mcp-servers/{name}/model`

Sets (or clears) a single MCP server's pricing model (`model:` in its `stack.yaml` entry). An empty string removes the key so the server falls back to `gateway.default_model`.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-opus-4-7"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/mcp-servers/github/model
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "server": "github",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2026-05-29T17:00:00Z"
}
```

`reloaded` is `false` (and `reloadedAt` omitted) when the daemon is running without live-reload.

**Errors:**
- `404` - Server not found in the stack file
- `409 stack_modified` - Stack file changed on disk between read and write
- `502 reload_failed` - YAML written but hot reload failed
- `503` - No stack file configured (stackless mode)

#### `PUT /api/gateway/default-model`

Sets (or clears) the stack-wide fallback pricing model (`gateway.default_model`). An empty string removes the key; the `gateway:` block is created when absent and removed again when clearing empties a block this endpoint created.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/gateway/default-model
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2026-05-29T17:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `409 stack_modified`, `502 reload_failed`, `503` (no stack file), as for the per-server endpoint above.

#### `PUT /api/clients/{slug}/model`

Sets (or clears) a single client's pricing model in the top-level `client_models:` map. An empty string removes the client's entry, and the whole `client_models:` map is removed when it empties. The slug is normalized to the stable profile key. This path never creates or touches a `clients:` access block (whose presence would flip the stack into default-deny access semantics).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-opus-4-7"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/clients/cursor/model
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "client": "cursor",
  "profileKey": "cursor",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "reloaded": true,
  "reloadedAt": "2026-05-29T17:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `409 stack_modified`, `502 reload_failed`, `503` (no stack file), plus `400 invalid_client` when the slug is empty after normalization.

#### `GET /api/pricing/models`

Returns the canonical model IDs known to the active pricing source, for UI model pickers. Free-text IDs outside this list are still accepted everywhere (best-effort pricing).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/pricing/models
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "source": "litellm",
  "models": ["claude-opus-4-7", "claude-sonnet-4-5", "gpt-4o"]
}
```

---

### Telemetry Persistence

Inspect and manage on-disk telemetry files under `~/.gridctl/telemetry/`. Complements the `gridctl telemetry` CLI.

#### `GET /api/telemetry/inventory`

Returns one record per `(server, signal)` pair that has at least one file on disk.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/telemetry/inventory
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "server": "github",
    "signal": "logs",
    "path": "/Users/me/.gridctl/telemetry/my-stack/github/logs.jsonl",
    "sizeBytes": 4096,
    "oldestTime": "2026-05-20T10:00:00Z",
    "newestTime": "2026-05-24T09:00:00Z",
    "fileCount": 1
  }
]
```

Returns `[]` when no stack is loaded or nothing has been persisted.

#### `DELETE /api/telemetry`

Wipes persisted telemetry files for the active stack.

**Auth:** Yes

| Query Param | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `server` | string | Limit to one MCP server |
| `signal` | string | Limit to `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces` |

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8180/api/telemetry?server=github&signal=logs"
```

Both query params are optional; omitting both wipes every server and signal. **Response:** `{success: true, inventory: [...]}` with the post-wipe inventory.

---

### Variables (Secrets & Config)

The variable store holds secrets (encrypted at rest) and plaintext config, organized into variable sets for scoped injection. The canonical route prefix is `/api/var`; `/api/vault/*` remains as a deprecated alias (responses carry `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers) and is removed at v1.0.

#### `GET /api/var/status`

Returns vault lock state and counts. Does not require the vault to be unlocked.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"set": "production"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{"key": "DB_PASSWORD", "set": "production", "status": "updated"}
```

#### `GET /api/var/usage`

Returns which stack nodes reference each `${var:KEY}` in the active stack. Derived from the loaded stack file only — no secret values, safe while the vault is locked.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/var/usage
```

```json
{
  "error": "vault is locked",
  "hint": "POST /api/var/unlock with passphrase"
}
```

---

### Schema Pins

Inspect and manage TOFU schema pins for MCP servers. Pins protect against rug pull attacks by detecting when an MCP server silently modifies its tool definitions. The pin store is automatically updated on deploy; these endpoints are for inspection and remediation.

#### `GET /api/pins`

Returns pin records for all servers in the deployed stack.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/pins
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "github": {
    "server_hash": "abc123...",
    "pinned_at": "2026-03-24T09:14:22Z",
    "last_verified_at": "2026-03-24T09:14:22Z",
    "tool_count": 23,
    "status": "pinned",
    "tools": {
      "github__create_pull_request": {
        "hash": "def456...",
        "name": "github__create_pull_request",
        "pinned_at": "2026-03-24T09:14:22Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Status values:** `"pinned"` | `"drift"` | `"approved_pending_redeploy"`

Returns `503` if the pin store is not available (schema pinning disabled globally).

#### `GET /api/pins/{server}`

Returns the pin record for a specific server.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/pins/github
```

Returns `404` if no pins exist for that server.

#### `POST /api/pins/{server}/approve`

Re-pins the current live tool definitions for a server, clearing drift status. Fetches tools directly from the running gateway router.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/pins/github/approve
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "server": "github",
  "tool_count": 23,
  "status": "approved"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` - No pins found for that server, or server not found in gateway
- `503` - Pin store not available

#### `DELETE /api/pins/{server}`

Deletes the pin record for a server. The server will be re-pinned on the next deploy.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/pins/github
```

**Response:** `204 No Content`

**Errors:**
- `404` - No pins found for that server

---

### Global Context

Manage the canonical global agent-context file (`~/.gridctl/context/AGENTS.md`) and its projection into each linked client's global context location. Backs `gridctl ctx` and the web UI's Global Context dialog; see [Global Context Sync](global-context.md) for concepts (write strategies, drift, adoption). These endpoints are pure file operations against the gateway host's home directory and work in stackless mode.

#### `GET /api/context`

Returns the canonical content and per-client sync state.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/context
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "canonical": {
    "path": "/home/user/.gridctl/context/AGENTS.md",
    "exists": true,
    "content": "# Global Agent Context\n..."
  },
  "needs_sync": false,
  "clients": [
    {
      "slug": "claude-code",
      "name": "Claude Code",
      "supported": true,
      "available": true,
      "strategy": "dedicated-file",
      "target_path": "/home/user/.claude/rules/gridctl.md",
      "state": "in-sync",
      "synced_at": "2026-07-15T13:22:12Z"
    },
    {
      "slug": "cursor",
      "name": "Cursor",
      "supported": false,
      "available": false,
      "state": "unsupported",
      "detail": "global User Rules are stored in app-internal storage; no supported file path"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `canonical` | object | Canonical file path, existence, and content (`content` is empty when `exists` is false) |
| `needs_sync` | bool | True when any client is `stale`, `drifted`, or `target-missing` |
| `clients` | []object | One entry per known client |

Per-client fields: `slug`, `name`, `supported`, `available` (client detected on this machine), `experimental` (omitted when false), `strategy` (`dedicated-file`, `import-shim`, or `block`; omitted for unsupported clients), `target_path`, `state`, `detail` (human-readable reason or hint), and `synced_at` (omitted when never synced).

**State values:** `"in-sync"` | `"stale"` | `"drifted"` | `"target-missing"` | `"never-synced"` | `"unsupported"`

#### `PUT /api/context`

Saves the canonical content (creating the file when absent) and returns the same document as `GET /api/context`. A timestamped backup of the previous revision precedes the write.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "# Global Agent Context\n\n- Prefer rg over grep.\n"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/context
```

**Errors:**
- `400` - Empty content, or content containing a reserved gridctl marker (`<!-- BEGIN GRIDCTL MANAGED -->`, `<!-- END GRIDCTL MANAGED -->`, or the managed-header prefix)

#### `GET /api/context/scan`

Reports what already exists at each supported client's global context location, for the adoption-first setup flow. Never writes.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/context/scan
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "slug": "claude-code",
      "name": "Claude Code",
      "path": "/home/user/.claude/CLAUDE.md",
      "exists": true,
      "size": 1189
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `POST /api/context/init`

Bootstraps the canonical file from a chosen source and returns the refreshed document. With `force`, replaces an existing canonical file (a timestamped backup is taken first) - this is what the web UI's Import action calls.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "client", "client": "claude-code"}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/context/init
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | string | `"template"` (starter draft), `"client"` (adopt a client's existing file), or `"file"` (adopt an arbitrary path) |
| `client` | string | Client slug; required when `source` is `"client"` |
| `path` | string | File path; required when `source` is `"file"` |
| `force` | bool | Overwrite an existing canonical file |

**Errors:**
- `400` - Invalid source, missing `client`/`path`, unknown client slug, or unsupported client
- `409` - Canonical file already exists and `force` is false

#### `POST /api/context/sync`

Projects the canonical context to clients. An empty (or absent) body syncs every available client.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clients": ["gemini"], "dry_run": true}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/context/sync
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clients` | []string | Client slugs to sync; omit for all available clients |
| `force` | bool | Overwrite drifted targets and repair corrupt managed blocks |
| `dry_run` | bool | Report what would change (with diffs) without writing |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "dry_run": false,
  "has_failures": false,
  "results": [
    {
      "slug": "gemini",
      "name": "Gemini CLI",
      "strategy": "import-shim",
      "target_path": "/home/user/.gemini/GEMINI.md",
      "action": "updated",
      "backup_path": "/home/user/.gemini/GEMINI.md.gridctl-backup-20260715-132212"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Action values:** `"created"` | `"updated"` | `"unchanged"` | `"skipped-drift"` | `"skipped-unavailable"` | `"error"`, plus `"would-create"` | `"would-update"` under `dry_run`

Unknown slugs, unsupported clients, and a missing canonical file abort the request (`400`/`404`); a per-client runtime failure becomes an `"error"` result row so earlier writes are still reported. Drifted targets are skipped (never silently overwritten) unless `force` is set.

#### `POST /api/context/adopt/{slug}`

Pulls a client's hand-edited managed content back into the canonical file, then re-syncs that client. Returns the refreshed document (other clients become `stale`). Only meaningful for dedicated-file and managed-block clients; import-shim clients reference the canonical file directly, so there is no copied content to adopt.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/context/adopt/opencode
```

**Errors:**
- `400` - Unsupported client
- `404` - Unknown client slug, or no canonical file exists
- `409` - Client was never synced or is not available

#### `POST /api/context/unsync/{slug}`

Removes what gridctl manages for one client and nothing else: dedicated files are deleted, shim lines and managed blocks are stripped. User-owned content is preserved.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/context/unsync/gemini
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "slug": "gemini",
  "target_path": "/home/user/.gemini/GEMINI.md",
  "action": "removed-region"
}
```

**Action values:** `"removed-file"` (dedicated file or a file gridctl created deleted) | `"removed-region"` (shim line or managed block stripped) | `"already-gone"`

**Errors:**
- `404` - Unknown client slug
- `409` - Client was never synced

#### `GET /api/context/diff/{slug}`

Returns the unified diff between the canonical context and a client's managed content (empty when identical).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/context/diff/opencode
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "slug": "opencode",
  "diff": "--- canonical\n+++ opencode\n@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n..."
}
```

**Errors:**
- `400` - Unsupported client
- `404` - Unknown client slug, or no canonical file exists

---

### Skill Sources *(experimental)*

Manage git-imported skill dependencies (`skills.yaml` + lock file). Mirrors `gridctl skill *` operations for the Library workspace.

Auth for private repos accepts an optional `auth` object on mutating endpoints:

```json
{
  "method": "token",
  "token": "ghp_...",
  "credentialRef": "${vault:GIT_TOKEN}",
  "sshKeyPath": "/path/to/key"
}
```

`credentialRef` is resolved against the live vault; raw `token` values are transient and never persisted.

#### `GET /api/skills/sources`

Lists imported sources with skill entries, auto-update settings, drift markers, and cached update availability.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/skills/sources
```

#### `POST /api/skills/sources`

Imports skills from a git repository.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "https://github.com/org/skills", "ref": "main", "trust": false, "selected": ["code-review"]}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/skills/sources
```

**Response:** `201 Created` with the import result. Git errors return `401`/`404`/`400` with redacted messages.

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/update`

Syncs every imported source in parallel (respects pinned refs). Optional body: `{force: true, skills: ["name"], auth: {...}}`.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/skills/sources/update
```

**Response:** `{sources[], syncedSources, updatedSkills, skippedSkills, failedSources, pinnedSources}`.

#### `GET /api/skills/updates`

Live-fetches upstream SHAs and returns pending update counts per source.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/skills/updates
```

#### `DELETE /api/skills/sources/{name}`

Removes a source and all skills it imported.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/{name}/check`

Checks whether a source has upstream changes without applying them.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{source, currentSha, latestSha, hasUpdate}`.

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/{name}/update`

Applies available updates for one source. Locally edited (drifted) skills are skipped unless `force: true`.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `GET /api/skills/sources/{name}/preview`

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/{name}/preview`

Previews skills in a repo without importing. GET accepts `repo`, `ref`, and `path` query params; POST accepts the same fields plus optional `auth` in the body. When `repo` is omitted, the stored source URL is used.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{repo, ref, commitSha, skills: [{name, description, body, valid, errors, warnings, findings, exists}]}`.

#### `GET /api/skills/sources/{name}/skills/{skill}/diff`

Returns local vs upstream `SKILL.md` with a unified diff. Read-only.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{skill, local, upstream, unifiedDiff, drifted}`.

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/{name}/skills/{skill}/detach`

Detaches a skill from its source so sync no longer touches it.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `{detached: "<skill>"}`.

#### `POST /api/skills/sources/{name}/skills/{skill}/reset`

Force-updates a single skill to upstream content, backing up the current file first.

**Auth:** Yes

---

### Registry (Agent Skills) *(experimental)*

Manage reusable skills stored as SKILL.md files. Skills have three lifecycle states: `draft`, `active`, and `disabled`.

#### `GET /api/registry/status`

Returns registry summary counts.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/registry/status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total": 5,
  "active": 3,
  "draft": 1,
  "disabled": 1
}
```

#### `GET /api/registry/skills`

Lists all skills.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills
```

#### `POST /api/registry/skills`

Creates a new skill.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "code-review", "description": "Review code changes", "state": "active", "content": "..."}'
```

**Response:** `201 Created` with skill JSON.

Returns `409 Conflict` if a skill with the same name already exists.

#### `POST /api/registry/skills/validate`

Validates SKILL.md content without saving.

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "---\nname: test\n---\n# Test Skill"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "parsed": { ... }
}
```

#### `PUT /api/registry/skills/batch`

Sets the state of multiple skills in one request, then refreshes the registry router once. Only `active` and `disabled` are accepted (bulk actions enable or disable; they never set `draft`).

**Auth:** Yes

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"skills": [
        {"name": "code-review", "state": "active"},
        {"name": "release-notes", "state": "disabled"}
      ]}' \
  http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/batch
```

The body must include a non-empty `skills` array; each entry needs a `name` and a `state`. Skill names must be unique within the batch.

**Validation is all-or-nothing:** every entry is checked (known skill, valid state) before any write, so an unknown skill (`404`) or invalid state (`400`) rejects the whole batch with nothing changed. The write phase itself is best-effort: a mid-batch save failure (`500`) can leave earlier entries persisted.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "skills": [
    {"name": "code-review", "state": "active"},
    {"name": "release-notes", "state": "disabled"}
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `400` - Empty `skills` array, an entry missing `name`, a duplicate skill, or an invalid state
- `404` - A named skill does not exist
- `503` - Registry not available

#### `GET /api/registry/skills/{name}`

Returns a specific skill.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `PUT /api/registry/skills/{name}`

Updates a skill. URL path name takes precedence over body name.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `DELETE /api/registry/skills/{name}`

Deletes a skill.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `204 No Content`

#### `POST /api/registry/skills/{name}/activate`

Activates a disabled or draft skill.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `POST /api/registry/skills/{name}/disable`

Disables an active skill (hides without deleting).

**Auth:** Yes

#### `GET /api/registry/skills/{name}/files`

Lists files in a skill directory.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `GET /api/registry/skills/{name}/files/{path...}`

Reads a file from a skill directory. Content-Type is detected from file extension. The `{path...}` segment is variadic, so nested sub-paths (e.g. `references/api/spec.json`) are supported.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `PUT /api/registry/skills/{name}/files/{path...}`

Writes a file to a skill directory. Body is raw file content. Maximum 1MB. The `{path...}` segment is variadic, so nested sub-paths are supported (parent directories are created as needed).

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `204 No Content`

#### `DELETE /api/registry/skills/{name}/files/{path...}`

Deletes a file from a skill directory. The `{path...}` segment is variadic, so nested sub-paths are supported.

**Auth:** Yes

**Response:** `204 No Content`

### MCP Protocol

The gateway negotiates the MCP protocol version at `initialize`: a requested
version in the supported set (`2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`,
`2024-11-05`) is echoed back, and any other value receives a successful
response carrying the latest supported version (the client decides whether to
disconnect). Post-initialize requests on `/mcp` (POST, GET, and DELETE) may
carry the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header; an absent header is accepted (the
session-negotiated version applies), while an unsupported value is rejected
with `400 Bad Request` naming the supported set. Malformed `initialize`
params return a JSON-RPC `InvalidParams` error.

#### `POST /mcp`

JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for MCP protocol operations.

**Auth:** Yes

**Supported methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `initialize` | Initialize MCP session |
| `tools/list` | List available tools |
| `tools/call` | Call a tool |
| `prompts/list` | List available prompts |
| `prompts/get` | Get a specific prompt |
| `resources/list` | List available resources |
| `resources/read` | Read a specific resource |
| `ping` | Connectivity check |
| `notifications/initialized` | Client initialization notification |

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8180/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "github__get_file_contents",
        "description": "Get file contents from a repository",
        "inputSchema": { ... }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Tool names are namespaced as `{server}__{tool}` to prevent collisions.

The streamable HTTP transport also serves two other verbs on `/mcp`:

#### `GET /mcp`

Opens a server-to-client SSE stream for the session identified by the
`Mcp-Session-Id` header. Clients may send `Last-Event-ID` to resume a
disconnected stream.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `DELETE /mcp`

Terminates the session identified by the `Mcp-Session-Id` header.

**Auth:** Yes

#### `GET /sse` (legacy compatibility)

Compatibility shim for clients that still probe the retired SSE transport.
Emits a single `endpoint` event directing the client to the streamable
endpoint, then closes; there are no sessions and no keepalives:

```
event: endpoint
data: POST /mcp
```

**Auth:** Yes

#### `POST /message` (retired)

Always returns `410 Gone` with a message pointing at `POST /mcp`. The
session-based SSE message endpoint was retired with the legacy transport.

**Auth:** Yes

### Static Files (Web UI)

#### `GET /`

Serves the embedded web UI. All unmatched paths fall back to `index.html` for SPA routing. Static assets are served with appropriate content types.

**Auth:** Yes

---

## Error Responses

All API errors return JSON:

```json
{"error": "error message"}
```

**Status codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Resource created |
| `204` | Success, no content |
| `400` | Invalid input or request |
| `401` | Missing or invalid authentication |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `405` | HTTP method not allowed |
| `409` | Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate name) |
| `423` | Vault is locked |
| `503` | Service unavailable (runtime not configured, reload not enabled) |

## CORS

The gateway sets CORS headers based on `gateway.allowed_origins`:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: {origin}
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Vary: Origin
```

`OPTIONS` preflight requests return `200 OK` with CORS headers without authentication.
