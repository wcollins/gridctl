# Registry Basic Example
#
# Demonstrates Agent Skills with a single MCP server. The registry stores
# reusable skills as SKILL.md files in ~/.gridctl/registry/skills/{name}/.
# Skills are NOT declared in stack YAML — they are managed via the REST API
# or Web UI.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Run `make mock-servers` from the project root to build the mock server.
#
# Usage:
#   gridctl deploy examples/registry/registry-basic.yaml
#
# After deploying, copy pre-made skills into the registry:
#   cp -r examples/registry/items/* ~/.gridctl/registry/skills/
#
# Then activate a skill:
#   curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/echo-and-time/activate
