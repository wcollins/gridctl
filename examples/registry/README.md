# Registry

Examples demonstrating the Agent Skills registry following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification.

## Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `registry-basic.yaml` | Single server with basic Agent Skills |
| `registry-advanced.yaml` | Two servers with cross-server skills |
| `skills.yaml` | Remote skill source list (public, private HTTPS via the variable store, private SSH via ssh-agent) |
| `items/code-review/` | Pre-made skill: code review checklist |
| `items/explain-error/` | Pre-made skill: error explanation helper |

## How the Registry Works

The registry stores Agent Skills as SKILL.md files - markdown documents with YAML frontmatter:

```
~/.gridctl/registry/
└── skills/
    └── {name}/
        ├── SKILL.md          # Required: frontmatter + markdown body
        ├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
        ├── references/       # Optional: reference materials
        └── assets/           # Optional: images, data files
```

Each skill has a lifecycle state:
- **draft** - stored but not exposed via MCP (default)
- **active** - exposed as an MCP prompt and resource
- **disabled** - temporarily hidden without deletion

Skills are managed via the REST API or Web UI - they are **not** declared in stack YAML.

## Skill Sources

`skills.yaml` (separate from the stack YAML above) declares **remote git repositories** that gridctl clones to import SKILL.md files. It lives at `~/.gridctl/skills.yaml` and is consumed by `gridctl skill update`.

```bash
# Use the provided example (edit sources first, stage any vault keys):
cp examples/registry/skills.yaml ~/.gridctl/skills.yaml
gridctl var set GIT_TOKEN --value ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   # only if using token auth
gridctl skill update
```

Private repos are supported via three auth methods, declared under `auth:`:

| Method | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `token` + `credential_ref: ${var:KEY}` | Private HTTPS repo; PAT stored in the encrypted variable store and re-resolved on every fetch |
| `ssh-agent` | Private SSH URL; uses the user's ambient ssh-agent + `~/.ssh/known_hosts` |
| `ssh-key` + `ssh_key_path` | Private SSH URL with an explicit on-disk key |

See [`docs/config-schema.md`](../../docs/config-schema.md#skill-sources) for the full field reference. One-shot / CI use can skip `skills.yaml` entirely and pass `--auth-token` or `--vault-key` directly to `gridctl skill add`.

## Prerequisites

Build the mock MCP servers:

```bash
make mock-servers
```

## Quick Start

### Option A: Copy Pre-Made Skills

```bash
# Copy skill directories into the registry
cp -r examples/registry/items/* ~/.gridctl/registry/skills/

# Deploy the stack
gridctl apply examples/registry/registry-basic.yaml

# Activate a skill
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/echo-and-time/activate
```

### Option B: Create via API

```bash
# Deploy the stack first
gridctl apply examples/registry/registry-basic.yaml

# Create a skill via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-skill",
    "description": "A helpful skill",
    "body": "# My Skill\n\nInstructions for the LLM..."
  }'

# Activate it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/my-skill/activate
```

## Pre-Made Skills

| Skill | Tags | For Stack |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `code-review` | development, review | any |
| `explain-error` | debugging, errors | any |
| `echo-and-time` | basic, demo | registry-basic |
| `add-and-echo` | chaining, demo | registry-basic |
| `chained-calculation` | cross-server, chaining | registry-advanced |

## SKILL.md Format

Skills use YAML frontmatter followed by a markdown body:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
tags:
  - category
allowed-tools: server__tool1, server__tool2
state: draft
---

# My Skill

Instructions, context, and workflow steps for the LLM.
```

**Required fields:** `name`, `description`

**Optional fields:** `tags`, `allowed-tools`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `state`

### Tool Naming

Tools are prefixed with the MCP server name to avoid collisions:

```
server-name__tool-name
```

For example, a server named `local-tools` with an `echo` tool becomes `local-tools__echo`.

## Testing

### REST API

```bash
# Check registry status
curl http://localhost:8180/api/registry/status | jq

# List all skills
curl http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills | jq

# Activate a skill
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/echo-and-time/activate

# Validate a SKILL.md without saving
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/validate \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/markdown' \
  -d '---
name: test
description: Test skill
---
# Test'

# Manage supporting files
curl http://localhost:8180/api/registry/skills/echo-and-time/files | jq
```

### Web UI

1. Open http://localhost:8180 in a browser
2. Navigate to the Registry section
3. Create and edit skills with the split-pane markdown editor
4. Activate skills and browse supporting files

### MCP Protocol

```bash
# List active skills as MCP prompts
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"prompts/list"}'

# Get a specific skill prompt
curl -X POST http://localhost:8180/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"prompts/get","params":{"name":"code-review"}}'
```
