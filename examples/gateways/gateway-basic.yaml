# Basic Gateway Example
#
# Demonstrates using Gridctl as a gateway to an existing MCP server.
# This pattern connects to an MCP server already running on your machine
# and exposes it through Gridctl's unified interface.
#
# Use cases:
#   - Connect multiple clients to a single MCP server
#   - Aggregate tools from multiple MCP servers
#   - Add Gridctl's monitoring and management layer
#
# Prerequisites:
#   An MCP server running and accessible via HTTP or SSE.
#   Update the url below to match your server's endpoint.
#
# Usage:
#   gridctl deploy examples/gateways/gateway-basic.yaml
#
#   Then connect clients to Gridctl's gateway URL:
#   http://localhost:8080/sse

  # Replace with your MCP server's URL and transport
